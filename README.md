## Introduction

Traffic Sign Detection and Recognition is a crucial component for autonomous vehicles and driver assistance systems. This project aims to accurately detect and classify traffic signs using deep learning techniques.

## Features

- Detects traffic signs from images.
- Classifies detected signs into predefined categories.
- High accuracy and performance.
- Easy-to-use interface for testing the model.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib


## Model Architecture

The model is built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for feature extraction and classification. It consists of several convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers, fully connected layers, and a softmax output layer.

## Dataset

The model is trained on the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) dataset, which contains more than 50,000 images of traffic signs in 43 classes.
